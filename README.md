# Atlas

My personal pet project - an iOS productivity app built with Swift and SwiftUI.

## About

I'm building this app to help me improve my productivity by breaking down big goals into actionable steps with AI assistance. The app uses Claude AI to generate structured plans and helps me stay focused on what needs to be done next.

## What it does

- Create long-term goals with deadlines
- Break goals into topics (milestones)
- Generate detailed task plans using AI
- Track progress with visual indicators
- Unlock tasks based on dependencies

## Tech Stack

- **Swift** & **SwiftUI** - Native iOS development
- **Anthropic Claude API** - AI-powered planning
- **Supabase** - Backend and authentication
- **MVVM** architecture

## Requirements

- iOS 16.0+
- Xcode 15.0+

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `To do App.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Configure Supabase credentials (see `.mcp.json.example`)
4. Build and run

This is a work in progress as I learn and improve my Swift skills.
